# Class-Work
Classwork Done in Java, Python, &amp; Database Management

All of the coursework here represents the work completed at time of submission. The intro java work dates from about 5 years ago, while the NLP, and DB Management are from 2-3 years ago. None of it is by any means production level work, and even stylistically there is quite a lot to improve upon, be it method implementation or a more rigorous approach to commenting, both method-level and in-line. 

TODO : Add more individualized Readme files for each project
